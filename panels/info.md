# Panels

This doc aims to give all the info on sizes, spacings and fonts.

## Fonts

Font for early paper-face panels and modern RandomSource, 73-75 and Elby panels is Futura.

RandomSouce has some differences though :-

* the printed *SERGE* logo seems to be Ultra-Bold Condensed
* all other font weights seem to be slightly bolder than the default (maybe *book*?)
* module titles seem to have wider letter spacing than the default

STS and Vintage Voltron panel font is all ITC Eras.
STS panels have module names and *Serge Modular* logo in demi bold, with panel text being normal weight. Voltron panels seem to just have normal weight but different font sizes throughout.

# Sizes

Panels are 175mm high, with mounting holes 4.5mm in from the top and bottom edges. This should put them 166mm apart and give enough space for mounting the rivet nuts in the enclosure lips.
It's worth noting that the Hammond 1773 enclosure seems to have a bit of an inwards bow to the edges, so the middle of the long edges are a little closer than at either end. To try and deal with this, mounting holes are about 3 inches in from each end, and none in the middle

Component mounting holes are mostly all on a 16 by 8 grid. 1 inch apart horizontally, and 0.75 apart vertically, with the top holes further from the edge than those at the bottom to accommodate panel heading text.

Assuming 8 vertical mounting holes, the top hole should be 24mm from the top of the panel (an inch minus the half of the 2.8 mm difference between panel height and a full 7 inches).
