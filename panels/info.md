# Panels

This doc aims to give all the info on sizes, spacings and fonts.

## Fonts

Font for early paper-face panels and modern RandomSource, 73-75 and Elby panels is Futura.

RandomSouce has some differences though :-

* the printed *SERGE* logo seems to be Ultra-Bold Condensed
* all other font weights seem to be slightly bolder than the default (maybe *book*?)
* module titles seem to have wider letter spacing than the default

STS and Vintage Voltron panel font is all ITC Eras.
STS panels have module names and *Serge Modular* logo in demi bold, with panel text being normal weight. Voltron panels seem to just have normal weight but different font sizes throughout.
